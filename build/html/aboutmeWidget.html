  <b>About me</b></br> I put this site together as a place to showcase the
  various websites and projects I've done, and to perhaps publish what I think
  might be useful for others to read.  If you are interested in contracting me
  to build a website for you, please head over to websites where I've listed the
  sites I've done so far and a little info on how it was done.  On the projects
  page I've listed a few of my more elaborate or interesting software projects
  I've done so far. The source code for these and others is up on github.  If
  you're interested in me personally please check out the about page. For more
  detailed background on me please checkout either linkedin or
  careers.stackoverflow.  Contact me at mail@axion5.net
