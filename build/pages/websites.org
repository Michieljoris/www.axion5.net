I am a programmer not a designer, however I try to make a site look as pleasing
as possible. My starting point is a usually a template, which I tweak and adapt
till it comes accross as some kind of unit, the exception so far has been the
greenglass site, which is actually bit more of a one page app then a traditional
website.

Built with Drupal and hosted very cheaply at nearlyfreespeech. The end user can
build their own galleries and add them to the site. Fully responsive, so mobile
ready.

Built with angularjs and bootstrap and running off a home spun nodejs
server. The site is built out of html fragments put together by my
html-builder. Mobile ready. Served from nodejitsu originally, but now from a
Linode server. End user is able to edit any body text inline after logging
in. The site automatically rebuilds itself after. Similarly the end user can
edit a list of videos. They get grouped automatically and listed on the
resources page. A bit similar to a blogging engine. In fact a blog has been
added recently, again with online and inline editing and removing of
posts.

A true one page app using angularjs and nodejs. The idea was to make a site that
resembles a gallery as closely as possible. You can make a selection of the kind
of terrarium by clicking the select button. The site uses isotope for the auto
rearranging images. End user is able to upload images from an ipad to
dropbox. By visiting the sync page the server pulls these images from there. The
end user is then able to add tags such as price and size to all images. The end
user has to log into the site to enable the editing features. The server is
again my own bb-server), running on AWS at the moment but will migrate to a
Linode server.
