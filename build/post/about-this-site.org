: title: About this site

This site is built using my own software since I was tired of jumping through
the hoops using blogging engines such as Hexo, Jekyll and Octopress. There was
always some problem, mainly because I forgot how to add posts or modify the site
everytime I thought of adding to the site. I forgot how to deploy, or I forgot
how to easily set it up on a new computer, or there other problems such as code
highlighting etc. This might have something to do with me not always reading
the manual too carefully, however in any case at long last I managed to put
something together myself that I think will suit me for a while.

: ------------------

One repo on github for building, cloning, syncing all the source code,
including the posts, pages and layout. Setting up the site on a new computer is
as easy as cloning the repo, doing an npm install, bower install and a =bin/serve= .

Adding or updating posts and pages is as easy as editing the files in the
build/post and build/pages directories. These files are all in org mode, so I
can use my org-mode formatting skills to layout any text, and not worry about
knowing/remembering yet another markup language such as markdown. Org-mode
allows me to have headings, lists, stylings, links, quotes, tables, lines and
hidden comments. 

Posts can have meta data at the top of the file, enabling or setting properties
like title, published, tags and comments. Run =bin/build= and on save the whole
site rerenders itself from scratch (with some caching though). Refresh the page
and my site is locally updated.

Updating the site on the net is done by just pushing the www directory to the
michieljoris.io.github repo.
