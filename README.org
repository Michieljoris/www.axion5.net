#+TITLE: www.axion5.net
Work in progress..

This is the repo of my personal site at www.axion5.net. It is build entirely
from files in org format. I edit/add/remove these files directly in/to/from the
build/pages and build/post directories. 

The site is an mplementation of [[http://github.com/michieljoris/bb-blog][bb-blog]] which is blogging extension for [[html://github.com/michieljoris/bb-server][bb-server]] and
[[http://github.com/michieljoris/html-builder][html-builder]], producing post pages, widgets, landing/latest, archive
and tag pages. Pagination is added when there are more post teasers than fit on
a page. Comments from Disqus can be enabled for all or per post. 

Clone the repo:

: git clone git@github.com:Michieljoris/www.axion5.net.git

Then:

: cd wwww.axion5.net
: npm install
: bower install
: bin/serve

Open your browser at [[http://localhost:9100][localhost:9100]] to see the site.

If you do a =bin/build= the site will rebuild itself on any changes to the org
and configuration files.

To send to the github [[http://github.com/michieljoris/michieljoris.github.io][michieljoris.github.io]] repo and update the [[http://www.axion5.net][www.axion5.net]]
site:
: bin/deploy
