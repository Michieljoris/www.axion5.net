title: Adea, an experiment in application back end infrastructure
tags: web internet rethink 
publishedat: 27/12/2014</pre>
<p>I believe firmly in decoupling front and back end, using messages for
communication, self reliance for individual machines in a network, auto
configuration for the network as a whole, &#39;backendless&#39; infrastructure and
depositing as much as functionality as possible in the front end. This can be
implemented lots of different ways, this blog post discusses a sketch of just one way,
dictated by limitations chosen. </p>
<pre>--------------------------------</pre>
<h3 id="header-0-1"><span class="section-number">0.1</span>Introduction</h3>
<p>As per the last <a href="http://www.axion5.net/post/the-web-is-not-a-good-fit-really.html">blog post</a> I want to try to sketch a system and infrastructure to
serve as the back end for a (web) app. I want to challenge some commonly held
ideas of how to organize such a thing. Since the legacy of a document based web
architecture has left us with a server-client paradigm and therefore a
functional application (the &#39;server&#39;) on the server side (as it has left us with
endless dom meddling on the client side) we&#39;re going reevaluate the use and
function of this server application. To do this properly we&#39;re going to try to
make do without it all together. Removing the server from the server-client
schism is one sure fire way to remove the schism and therefore break the old
paradigm. Some interesting things might follow from this. </p>
<p>The system is being described by listing a fair amount of ideas that taken
together describe a possible working setup. Once the ideas crystallize I might
(be able to) describe it all a bit more formally. </p>
<h3 id="header-0-2"><span class="section-number">0.2</span>Limitations</h3>
<p>Since this is an experiment I am setting some limitations, in particular
technologies used. They are relatively novel, and also few in number:</p>
<ol><li><a href="https://www.docker.com/">docker</a>: For ready made instances of the following three.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.serfdom.io/">serf</a>: To coordinate servers in a multi-server setup</li>
<li>A proxy server: To control access to a particular vps/machine and/or databases</li>
<li><a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/">couchdb</a>: Data has to be stored somewhere..</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="header-0-3"><span class="section-number">0.3</span>Goal</h3>
<p>A working setup, that needs minimal maintenance, auto scales, can be setup with
minimal effort, and can be used for any app. Once this thing works writing any
web app should involve minimal change to the back end and should only need to
concentrate wholly on the front end. With some libraries a lot of the boiler
plate dealing with the back end should again be possible to abstract away. By
using reactjs it is possible to abstract away the dom. Combining the two allows
the app developer to concentrate on the actual functionality as much as
possible.</p>
<h3 id="header-0-4"><span class="section-number">0.4</span>Requirements:</h3>
<p>The following is a list of requirements and ideas for the setup. Some are essential, some
can be compromised on. But all try to make use of the technologies as best as possible.</p>
<h4 id="header-0-4-1"><span class="section-number">0.4.1</span>Apps talk directly to a database at all times</h4>
<p>This leverages the http end point feature of couchdb. Couchdb has also a solid
authentication and authorization system built-in and has no problem with dealing
with a lot of connections at the same time (Erlang based). Further more it is
good at replicating databases between instances and is able to provide a changes
feed, thus enabling apps to directly respond to changes in a database.</p>
<h4 id="header-0-4-2"><span class="section-number">0.4.2</span>A solid read and write permission and role system needs to implemented </h4>
<p>This is a problem for couchdb since it is not very good at read validation, and
only checks access at a database level. The usual solution is to separate the
data into multiple databases based on read permissions. But we still want the
data to replicate between instances.</p>
<h4 id="header-0-4-3"><span class="section-number">0.4.3</span>All data is contained in one database (aggregate) which is replicated between pods.</h4>
<p>This is pull and push replication. However data from the aggregate gets
replicated only one way only into partial databases. The aggregate also contains a
copy of every user doc. </p>
<h4 id="header-0-4-4"><span class="section-number">0.4.4</span>Every pod instance copies user docs to the _user database when required</h4>
<p>But this only needs to be done for active users. This way duplication can be
minimized. A client app can send a message requesting access for a particular
email address or user name and rean can then copy the proper user doc to the
_users database, and set up the required partial databases as well. Something
might be possible to set up so that updated user docs can be replicated to the
_users database, while leaving not active users for some pod can be left out of
the _users database.</p>
<h4 id="header-0-4-5"><span class="section-number">0.4.5</span>Users can never access the main aggregate.</h4>
<p>Instead they access duplicates of this data from partitioned by access
databases. This can be enforced when couchdb implements the validate doc read
function, or when using rcouch. Otherwise this will have to be enforced by the
proxy by disallowing any get on the aggregate database.</p>
<h4 id="header-0-4-6"><span class="section-number">0.4.6</span>New users can only register at the write master</h4>
<p>This also goes for the forget password procedure. For new users to register some
hoops have to jumped through since we still don&#39;t want a back end server and the
new user, or the client app can only talk to to the database directly by writing
docs to a public database. The procedure is described in my github repos <a href="http://github.com/michieljoris/cape">cape</a>
and a demo is at <a href="http://github.com/michieljoris/authpages">authpages</a></p>
<h4 id="header-0-4-7"><span class="section-number">0.4.7</span>Aggregate database is partitioned by documents&#39; access signatures</h4>
<p>All docs are accessible by a unique set of users. This can be one user, all
users, or a particular subset. Every doc can limit its accessibility by defining
it in a property. This is a list of roles and individual users that is allowed
to read the doc. Other properties decide on write and modify rights, enforced by
couchdb&#39;s validate doc update. Since every doc has a unique &#39;access signature&#39;
the whole set of docs can be partitioned by access signature. For every
partition a database can be set up and using filtered replication all docs will
be replicated to one and only one database.</p>
<h4 id="header-0-4-8"><span class="section-number">0.4.8</span>Access signature can also be function of doc&#39;s properties</h4>
<p>In this case not the parameters to a replication&#39;s filter are changed (as read
from a doc&#39;s access object) but the filter itself. In this case all partial
databases might have to be torn down, recreated and replications set up again.
Or the change of access signature recalculated for every doc so they get removed
from databases where they not longer belong.</p>
<h4 id="header-0-4-9"><span class="section-number">0.4.9</span>Rean is the name of the set of workers behind couchdb</h4>
<p>These workers are either put into action by a particular change in the aggregate
database or periodically inspect the state of couchdb themselves. They can for
instance respond to messages sent to by client apps. Rean will also initialize
its couchdb instance. Rean runs in a docker container with a serf instance
hooked up to the pod ring if the pod is part of one. Rean will look for its
configuration in the couchdb instance if it&#39;s not the first pod in the ring to
be started up. Otherwise it will create the aggregate and save its config in it
to be replicated to any other pods. Needs some pondering still about how to
start this up properly with minimal effort...</p>
<h4 id="header-0-4-10"><span class="section-number">0.4.10</span>All docs written to the aggregate get validated by a validate doc update function (vdu)</h4>
<p>This function has access to the doc written, the doc to be updated, the
database&#39;s security object and the user&#39;s roles and id. Whether a doc gets
written is thus a function of all of these parameters. This function cannot
rewrite the documents, however it can make sure that the document adhere to some
properties. For instance the user that updates it can be enforced to be included
as a property.</p>
<h4 id="header-0-4-11"><span class="section-number">0.4.11</span>All docs written may need to include access signature of the old doc as a property</h4>
<p>This gets enforced by the aggregate&#39;s vdu. The vdu has access to the doc that&#39;s
being updated and calculates its access signature, as well as the access
signature of the updated doc. If the access signature of the updated doc is
included this can get validated by the vdu as well. The access signature of the
old doc would be the name of the database where the doc was read from. When a
client app reads the doc directly from a partial database it can include it in
the updated doc as a property, if it doesn&#39;t know it can include the old doc as
a separate property, or it can use the aggregate&#39;s update doc function. This
update doc function can rewrite the doc and add the old access signature
property, as well as the new. If a doc does not change it signature on update no
signatures need to added as properties to the updated doc.</p>
<p>Client apps might also be able to calculate a doc&#39;s access signature themselves
using the access object in the doc (but won&#39;t work if ps function applies to
doc), or ask a pod to calculate the signature and add it itself.</p>
<h4 id="header-0-4-12"><span class="section-number">0.4.12</span>Rean sets up a database and one way replication for every access signature</h4>
<p>The aggregate database has a design doc with a filter that takes a parameter.
Every replication to every partial database uses the same filter but passes a
different parameter to make sure that every partial database receives only the
documents that match the access signature of the partial database. If a doc has
a property defining its access signature it is used (has to be correct
because of the vdu), otherwise the filter function will calculate it itself. </p>
<h4 id="header-0-4-13"><span class="section-number">0.4.13</span>Documents with changed access signature do not get replicated anywhere.</h4>
<p>They await intervention from rean. All replications (to partial databases and
other pods) use a filter function that prevents documents such as this from
being replicated. This mechanism is to prevent any docs from not being removed
from a partial database. A change feed is not guaranteed to provide all changes,
only the latest, so intermediate docs may be overlooked by rean, which means
docs may not be removed from partial databases while they should. A document
cannot be updated till the old version is removed from a partial database it no
longer belongs in.  </p>
<h4 id="header-0-4-14"><span class="section-number">0.4.14</span>Rean cleans up docs from partial databases when access signature changes </h4>
<p>Every doc with a changed access signature will get processed by rean. It will
delete the doc in the partial database with the old access signature. After this
it will rewrite the doc but it will set the old access signature property to the
updated version. This will again pass the vdu, but now it will get replicated to
the proper partial database. It will also get replicated to other pods if there
are any replications setup. </p>
<h4 id="header-0-4-15"><span class="section-number">0.4.15</span>Every document in the aggregate might be duplicated in one of the partial databases</h4>
<p>But only once. No two partial databases may and can contain the same
document (by id). When there are no users logged in that have access to a
particular partial database, it can be torn down by rean, and rebuilt when a
user requires it again. But this is optional.</p>
<h4 id="header-0-4-16"><span class="section-number">0.4.16</span>Rean writes special docs with delete instructions </h4>
<p>For every doc that moves to another partial database (because its access
signature changed) rean writes a doc with instructions to delete a particular
doc with a particular revision from a particular partial database. These docs get
replicated to other pods where the local reans can then carry out the
instructions and remove these docs in its partial databases. These delete
instruction docs have a sequential number. Every rean in every pod updates their
status doc with the sequence number of the latest delete instruction doc carried
out. The write master can periodically check these status docs and remove these
delete instruction docs up to the lowest sequential number reported. These
deletes will replicated to to other pods. Rean can choose to add delete
instructions in bulk to one of these delete instruction docs.</p>
<h4 id="header-0-4-17"><span class="section-number">0.4.17</span>A node can fail and this does not affect the pod ring</h4>
<p>This will get reported by serf to all other pods. Every pod writes a info doc
that does not get replicated to other pods, but does get replicated to a
generally accessible partial database. Each pod will at all times report in this
info doc the databases it knows are accessible (from serf). It&#39;s the client
app&#39;s responsibility to fetch this document and listen for changes to it. A
client that was connected to the failing pod can now try to access a working
pod. New clients will not try to connect to the failing one. When the pod comes
back online the same process gets repeated to let clients know its back online.
If all fails a client can appeal to dns server again or any central app registry
if it exists.</p>
<h4 id="header-0-4-18"><span class="section-number">0.4.18</span>A proxy may be necessary to enforce read restrictions on databases</h4>
<p>Couchdb is good at validating writes, but not at reads. In particular it cannot
prevent reading from a database and only allow writing. This is necessary
however for the aggregate. So until couchdb implements &#39;validate doc read&#39; a
proxy is necessary.</p>
<h4 id="header-0-4-19"><span class="section-number">0.4.19</span>A pod&#39;s public port is the proxy.</h4>
<p>Furthermore serf and couchdb need to be able to connect to other pods/machines.
But couchdb itself should not be publicly accessible.So maybe it should go
through proxy as well when replicating with other couchdb instances. So maybe
the proxy can check for the proper password when it gets a direct connection
request for couchdb. This proxy is also useful for when rean wants to shut down
or do maintenance on the pod.</p>
<h4 id="header-0-4-20"><span class="section-number">0.4.20</span>The proxy is either something like bounce.js or haproxy</h4>
<p>Both are controllable and programmable, and will sit in a docker container with
a serf instance. It can then respond to messages from the local rean for instance.</p>
<h4 id="header-0-4-21"><span class="section-number">0.4.21</span>Every pod decides independently which pod is the pod master</h4>
<p>A write master is chosen based on its id. The highest id wins, or whatever
algorithm or preferences are set in the configuration of rean. Once a write
master fails all other pods will learn of this via serf. Each one will
independently know which one should become the new write master. The one with
the highest id will then open its aggregate for writing. If there are no docs in
the failing pod that still haven&#39;t replicated this process is safe. All clients
will be notified or can query which pod is the new write master. When a failed
write master comes back online any docs that replicated yet before it failed
might now get in a conflicted state. So in general any write master that finds
itself newly elected may have to check for conflicts and resolve them.</p>
<h4 id="header-0-4-22"><span class="section-number">0.4.22</span>Pods are responsible themselves for deleting docs from their partial databases</h4>
<p>When a pod goes offline and then after some time online again, the write master
might have given up on the pod and removed the delete instruction docs as part
of maintenance. The local rean can deduce this from the fact that there is a gap
between the earliest delete instruction doc in its aggregate and the latest one
it reported as deleted in its own status doc. In this case the local rean can
either remove all partial databases and start all replication again to new empty
partial databases or laboriously compare all docs in the partial databases with
the ones in the aggregate and clean up appropriately.</p>
<h4 id="header-0-4-23"><span class="section-number">0.4.23</span>In a pod ring every pod maintains its own pod status document</h4>
<p>Which gets replicated to all other pods. In this document is data such as pod
id, couchdb stats, vps stats and index of latest delete instruction doc carried
out. Nobody else writes to this document but the pod itself. They get replicated
to all other pods. </p>
<h4 id="header-0-4-24"><span class="section-number">0.4.24</span>No dns, or at least no hard dependency.</h4>
<p>A user needs to find the app, so an url for that will be needed, and a dns
look up. One could use a central place where pods or pod rings register ip
addresses. Once an app is loaded (from a pod&#39;s database for instance) one could
imagine that the app questions the pod on other ip addresses of other pods in
the ring. Or again looks in a central registry where pods register their ip
addresses. Pods might also be able to configure their own dns settings using a
the api of some dns server if possible. An app only needs access to one pod,
somehow, to be able to access the others.</p>
<h4 id="header-0-4-25"><span class="section-number">0.4.25</span>No load balancing, instead clients find their own most efficient server</h4>
<p>Once an app knows the ip addresses of all the pods in a ring, it can be made the
app&#39;s responsibility to choose the pod with the most capacity in terms of
connections or latency or other parameters it either can measure itself, or that
are being reported by the separate pods. Remember, all pods know all about all
other pods in a pod ring.</p>
<h4 id="header-0-4-26"><span class="section-number">0.4.26</span>Every machine or vps and its pod is completely autonomous</h4>
<p>Meaning it can take action without being told so by a master vps, and no vps is
more important than another. It can manage its own affairs and no decision or
action it takes should endanger the cluster. No vps is dependent on another vps.
All knowledge of the cluster is shared. Etc, you get the idea. </p>
<h4 id="header-0-4-27"><span class="section-number">0.4.27</span>Client is totally independent from back end database and vice versa</h4>
<p>Neither should expect or demand anything from the other. Client should
politely request for data and if not granted or received solve its own problems.
Back end workers though should do their best to accommodate and anticipate
clients&#39; needs, and organize things as best as they can.  This means keeping
public, reception, post office and mailboxes in order, and any replications
that are needed between them etc, and respond to client messages as well as possible.</p>
<h4 id="header-0-4-28"><span class="section-number">0.4.28</span>A cluster, or pod ring is self adjusting, depending on load.</h4>
<p>A master pod should get elected whose responsibility it is to add and remove
pod, that is, vps instances. Whether this should happen depends on the pod
ring&#39;s configuration. Every pod reports at all times its status and load via a
shared status doc. Based on that decisions can be made about scaling by the
master pod.</p>
<h4 id="header-0-4-29"><span class="section-number">0.4.29</span>A pod ring should be robust and be able to cope with all but one pod failing</h4>
<p>Using a watts-newman small world network between pods all pods should keep
replicating to each other and stay in sync at all times. The watts-newman
network model can be implemented by every single pod independently without
consulting or taking into account what other pods decide to connect to. It also
predicts relatively low average hop count even when there are dozens and dozens
or possibly hundreds of pods in a pod ring. When a pod disappears from a pod
ring it will self adjust, as it will when a pod is added (again). For this to
work every pod needs a working serf instance that has been hooked up to the pods
serf network, as the pod knows about the network through serf. A visual demo of
the watts-newman network is at <a href="http://github.com/michieljoris/deploy-demo">deploy-demo</a>.</p>
<p>Clients will also always notice a pod failing and should redirect requests to another pod
in the ring if the app is designed properly.</p>
<h4 id="header-0-4-30"><span class="section-number">0.4.30</span>A user can start a new pod ring with just the data accessible in another pod ring</h4>
<p>So users own their data. They can replicate their own data to a pod they control
and then delete the data in the old pod (ring). When the data is shared with
other users, they will also not be able to use the old pod (ring) to access the
data.</p>
<h4 id="header-0-4-31"><span class="section-number">0.4.31</span>Apps should leverage couchdb&#39;s replication and changes feed features</h4>
<p>With a bit effort separate users of the same app and connecting to the same pod
(ring) should be easy to sync up with each other using these couchdb features.
The ultimate goal is to achieve parity with most features in meteorjs.It should
be for instance pretty easy to send messages between users.</p>
<h4 id="header-0-4-32"><span class="section-number">0.4.32</span>Every pod has minimal workers behind its database</h4>
<p>These workers are doing registration, send emails, do maintenance on the
databases, monitor and report the pods state etc, but should contain minimal app
or business logic. This should reside in the apps/client themselves. It is the
question in how far you can go with this. </p>
<h4 id="header-0-4-33"><span class="section-number">0.4.33</span>The whole system is message based</h4>
<p>From pod to pod and from pod to app. This maximizes decoupling. No app or pod
should be reliant on a specific response or for that matter any response to a
message sent. If a message is confirmed, or other wise is returning data the app
may use this, but it can not expect or wait for this. It should be able to make
do and not fail or otherwise &#39;crash&#39;, but should always present a reasonable ui to
the user and do its best to resolve the situation. Data should always be
retrieved by direct database access. </p>
<h4 id="header-0-4-34"><span class="section-number">0.4.34</span>No possibility of creating document conflicts</h4>
<p>A logical consequence of having only one writable pod, and creating only one way
replications. From aggregate to other aggregates and from all aggregates to
the partial databases on their respective pods. However a bulk save of docs with
the all-or-nothing set might create conflicts. Maybe the vdu can check for
conflicts by comparing revision numbers? Or the proxy might disallow this
particular request.</p>
<h4 id="header-0-4-35"><span class="section-number">0.4.35</span>A proxy is used for basic read access control.</h4>
<p>For maintenance it might be useful to cut of access to a couchdb instance, or
certain databases can be made write-only by disallowing get requests on the
database. This proxy can also do basic reporting and logging of connections and
requests.</p>
<h4 id="header-0-4-36"><span class="section-number">0.4.36</span>No sessions or cookies </h4>
<p>Instead users get a temporary ogin and pwd to access a database. This
user name/pwd can expire. This bypasses and ignore session cookies and therefore
csrf. An web app still needs to store this pwd in local storage. Meteorjs talks
about storing session tokens in local storage in this <a href="https://www.meteor.com/blog/2014/03/14/session-cookies">blog post</a> and expands on
the rationale. This does require an https connection and a web app will have to
send a user name/pwd with every request. Meteorjs only sends this session token
once when setting up the ddp connection. Since every request is actually a login
and the crypto algorithm to hash a password used by couchdb is pbkdf2 login
attempts can be throttled to any arbitrary rate. So timing attacks become
difficult. Web apps would be mostly listening to a change feed, which are long
lasting connections. The issue still remains of a secret token (login pwd) sent
with every request.</p>
<p>To create a quasi session create a temp user with the same roles as actual
user, with the added role of the user id (user email). This user can be
replicated to other couch instances and it will still work. The session expires
when the user account gets deleted, which rean can do after a certain amount of
no pings from client, or after a message from client. When the proper user account
doesn&#39;t have the email as role it can&#39;t be used to access any of the dbs, except
to ask for a session.</p>
<h4 id="header-0-4-37"><span class="section-number">0.4.37</span>Every pod consists of adea and docker containers</h4>
<p>A vps or machine needs to have docker installed, a run time (node, erlang,
clojure) and serf and a port open to the proxy container. Adea is the software
that is responsible for adding and removing docker containers.  Adea is
responsible for starting and stopping docker containers. It communicates with
the pod and the pod ring through serf. It can do some basic host status
reporting. This agent should be as simple and robust as possible.</p>
<h4 id="header-0-4-38"><span class="section-number">0.4.38</span>A pod ring shares a pod ring configuration document</h4>
<p>In this document are the settings and parameters to properly configure rean.
This doc gets replicated to all other pods and their aggregate databases. But
are not replicated to any partial database.</p>
<h4 id="header-0-4-39"><span class="section-number">0.4.39</span>A pod ring can add, activate, deactivate and remove its members</h4>
<p>If in the rean config doc there are credentials for any virtual server providers
such as aws, linode, digital ocean or any other vps provider and rean is
configured to auto scale one could devise an algorithm where a pod gets elected
to start up a new vps using a vagrant script for instance. Rean could also for
instance monitor money spent and shut down or start up pods depending on a
budget. This is possible because a pod ring self adjusts to pods being added or
removed from a pod ring. A new vps only needs adea, serf and docker installed.
Adea needs to be started up and join the right serf cluster (with the proper
secret) and the password to the couchdb instances of the pod ring. Somehow this
secret and password needs to be given or passed in when the vps is started up.
After this the pod instance should be able to look after itself without any
further control or meddling from other pods.</p>
<h3 id="header-0-5"><span class="section-number">0.5</span>Compromises/trade-offs</h3>
<p>Some compromises have already been discussed in the requirements but here are
some more I could think of:</p>
<h4 id="header-0-5-1"><span class="section-number">0.5.1</span>Easily scalable for read operations, but not for write operations</h4>
<p>An app can use any pod to read from, but only one to write to, and that pod is
the same for all clients. This is not only to prevent document conflicts, but
also to enable proper implementation of a access system based on permissions and
roles.</p>
<h4 id="header-0-5-2"><span class="section-number">0.5.2</span>No sharding of data</h4>
<p>But one can use bigcouch, cloudant or couchdb 2.0 for this if needed. Every pod
has a complete copy of all the data. So this system favors connection heavy, cpu
heavy applications, since we can keep firing up new pods to deal with additional
load. But a vps has a limit on how data it can store (hard disk limit), plus all
this will have to be replicated to every new pod on creation. This becomes
troublesome once we&#39;re talking about gigabytes of data. One solution would be to
store big files such as images and video and sound files outside the pod ring
and in a key value store somewhere. But that would need a server in front of it
to enforce permissions.</p>
<h4 id="header-0-5-3"><span class="section-number">0.5.3</span>Every node uses (multiple) duplication of data to control read access.</h4>
<p>Even when couchdb implements &#34;validate doc read&#34; this will be necessary because
views are recalculated into indexed and will not use the &#34;vdr&#34; function to validate
read access. Every pod therefore will have to duplicate its data to some degree.
If all data is accessed in a pod by users it will have a duplication ratio of
at least two. If the pod is nice enough to then aggregate this again to some
degree or other for individual users the duplication ratio might be much higher
than two. On the other hand every pod only needs to leave in one piece the main
aggregate that&#39;s replicated between pods. All other databases it can destroy and
create at its own discretion, taking matters such as load and space into
consideration. This will mess with users who are reading from these databases,
or have change feeds set up of course. </p>
<h4 id="header-0-5-4"><span class="section-number">0.5.4</span>Client apps will have their accessible data spread amongst several partial databases</h4>
<p>However a pod can decide, based on hard disk space available to set up a database
for every user where all the data that&#39;s accessible for that user gets
replicated into. This will eat space if there is a lot of data that is shared.
If all data is shared all data will get duplicated as many times as there are users.
You could work out an algorithm where rean calculates how much data each user
has access to (the sum of the size partial databases he has access to) and then
divide the free space by the number of (active) users and then replicate as much
as possible to a user specific database. A client app can then query rean which
databases it should read from. The other option is to write messages to a
generally accessible database about all changes to the aggregate. Clients can
listen for (filtered) changes in this general database and then fetch the docs
based on reported changes in the aggregate. </p>
<h3 id="header-0-6"><span class="section-number">0.6</span>Work to be done!</h3>
<p>The above sketches a system that has not been fully fleshed out yet but seems
like it could work as a whole. The system tries to exploit to the fullest the
strongest points of each technology used such as docker, couchdb, serf, proxies
and vps providers. It also tries to approach the problem of the client-server
schism in a I hope somewhat original way, discarding some other truisms about
setting up a back end infrastructure along the way about load balancing,
sessions, dns and scaling. Whether it works I don&#39;t know, I have to build most
of it still. What does work is the authentication and sign up so far.</p>
<h3 id="header-0-7"><span class="section-number">0.7</span>Questions and research</h3>
<h4 id="header-0-7-1"><span class="section-number">0.7.1</span>How would this system go about implementing the following?</h4>
<ol><li>trello</li>
<li>shop</li>
<li>wiki</li>
<li>social network</li>
<li>inventory</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="header-0-7-2"><span class="section-number">0.7.2</span>User names or emails as ids? </h4>
<p>Lots of authentication systems use both, but this creates confusion for users,
because they don&#39;t know which one to use for which site or app. User names seem
to make more sense because email addresses change. However email addresses are
always unique.</p>
<h4 id="header-0-7-3"><span class="section-number">0.7.3</span>Can workers run in parallel?</h4>
<p>Can you set multiple reans to work on one couchdb? </p>
<h4 id="header-0-7-4"><span class="section-number">0.7.4</span>Cache requests in memcache perhaps?</h4>
<p>Rean is already listening to changes so it can invalidate queries and views.</p>
<h4 id="header-0-7-5"><span class="section-number">0.7.5</span>Multiple apps per pod ring?</h4>
<p>Yes, that&#39;s possible, just prefix all doc types with the app name. So a client
app can just pull the app specific data from the partial databases.</p>
<h4 id="header-0-7-6"><span class="section-number">0.7.6</span>Multiple groups of users for one app in a pod ring</h4>
<p>Like a saas?</p>
<h4 id="header-0-7-7"><span class="section-number">0.7.7</span>Splitting of pod rings into two rings?</h4>
<p>Don&#39;t know why you&#39;d want to do this.</p>
<h4 id="header-0-7-8"><span class="section-number">0.7.8</span>Where is the client app? </h4>
<p>In the aggregate? Pulled down from some repository somewhere?</p>
<h4 id="header-0-7-9"><span class="section-number">0.7.9</span>Deploying/updating software?</h4>
<p>How to update the app within the pod ring? How to update rean? How to update
technologies used, or for that matter the os of a vps?</p>
<h4 id="header-0-7-10"><span class="section-number">0.7.10</span>A/B testing?</h4>
<p>Should be easy to do because it&#39;s so useful. But how?</p>
<h4 id="header-0-7-11"><span class="section-number">0.7.11</span>What&#39;s the api for docker? From node? From clojure?</h4>
<p>Because we need to do this from adea. Apparently docker&#39;s api is a bit iffy.</p>
<h4 id="header-0-7-12"><span class="section-number">0.7.12</span>How to bootstrap a pod or pod ring?</h4>
<p>In principle a pod only needs an open port on a vps (with docker installed) with
an instance of adea and possibly serf running. But it needs be fed a configuration. This
can maybe written straight to the couchdb instance. Rean can react to this and
bootstrap itself and configure couchdb properly. But really all you is start rean
with a particular config and it will provision one or more vps&#39;s and build the
pod ring. </p>
<h4 id="header-0-7-13"><span class="section-number">0.7.13</span>Big files (video, images, sound) should not be replicated around</h4>
<p>But should be in a key value store somewhere (DynamoDB perhaps). Or in a
separate database with a validate read access function on it. Or use a proxy to
control access. But this complicates access to these resources. Needs more
thought.</p>
