title:The web is not a good fit really.. 
tags: web internet rethink </pre>
<p>Mobile and web apps are in wild demand and built by and for everybody. Yet
nobody knows quite yet how to consistently and reliable structure and organize
the back nor the front end. Some solutions are more popular then others, but
there is no consensus, and fashion and fads seem to have undue influence. I want
to talk about why and how this has come about and some ideas on improving the
situations.</p>
<pre>--------------------</pre>
<p>Mobile apps are built using either decades old system desktop languages (java),
or a company adapted version of C (more recently a purposefully designed
language, swift). These languages are not exchangeable for other languages
compiling to the same VM or machine code, nor are these the languages developers
would necessarily choose if they had a choice.This is in complete contrast to
the situation on the desktop (any language you like), or even on on the front
end in the browser (list of transpilers to javascript is <a href="https://github.com/jashkenas/coffeescript/wiki/list-of-languages-that-compile-to-js">huge</a>).</p>
<p>Companies are realizing that the traditional back ends based on java or php are
not the most flexible or nimble, dare I say agile, and are jumping either on the
nodejs bandwagon, or trying alternatives such as a scala (play) or python
(django) framework.</p>
<p>The situation on the front end is similarly confused. From adding simple effects
using javascript, to using jquery to more easily manage the dom and then
adopting a multitude of mvc frameworks, the history of front end seems to be a
chase to more and more easily gat a grip on app development without ever really
getting a real grip on the medium itself.</p>
<p>A slow but certain move is underway of functionality from back end to front end.
This is caused by the gradual realization that on the front end, the browser has
a pretty decent (javascript) runtime. Web sites are turning into and being built
more and more as (web) applications. Underlying all this lies a real confusion
of what the web was and what it maybe can be. The web was originally built and
conceived as a massive hyperlinked collection of &#39;documents&#39;. A massive wiki.
Not a distributor of applications. Yet that is what the web is being used as and
for more and more.</p>
<p>Frameworks, systems and libraries that were built to create and serve
&#34;documents&#34; have been and are being adapted to serve &#34;applications&#34;, or to use
the more usual awful misnomer: &#34;dynamic documents&#34;. The first step on this road
was made when static file servers were modified to execute scripts instead of
serving a static file (cgi) when receving requests, and logically led to servers
that were a runtime itself (nodejs). From complete configurability (apache) to
complete programmability (nodejs).</p>
<p>In the meantime web sites, web apps and mobile apps need to be served and
supplied with data, sometimes on an enormous scale. Website hosting service
providers are being replaced with providers of raw computing power and internet
bandwidth (aws, gce). The problem of scalability and distributed computing and
data is not solved, with companies either outsourcing the solution, or building
proprietary systems, or a combination. Old ideas and technologies are being
rediscovered and/or repackaged (docker, erlang) in an effort to get a handle on
the problem. Companies that are quick to learn and adapt or are new (startups,
think whatsapp) see their advantage and are able to significantly increase their
chance to unsettle older and bigger companies.</p>
<p>Yet no matter how easy to use the tools on both back and front end are becoming,
and how much the back end infrastructure and service providers are adapting and
improving, a lot of practices are still embedded in the old paradigm of the web
as a document serving mechanism.</p>
<p>Functionality needs to be delivered to people, better known as consumers if
you&#39;re the money making kind. The old way of doing this was by building a
desktop application, writing it to a magnetic disc, shrink wrapping and selling
it over the counter. An application developer only had to deal with one
computer, one (fixed) set and source of data (disc) and one user. The user
interface was a &#39;view&#39; of the &#39;data&#39;. No mvc framework needed. No network
latency or disconnection to worry about. No browser incompatibility to work
around. No endless libraries and frameworks trying to solve the same problem
over and over. Etc, etc.</p>
<p>Come the web app and the thing is cleft perfectly in two. Most of the
programmer&#39;s work is spent on adapting, writing, working around limitations of
both halves, working against a legacy that was never designed to deliver
application type functionality. An application developer is now worrying about
load balancing, distributed data, sharding, document naming (dns), paths and
urls, asynchronicity, state management, the list is endless. In the end however
all this is boilerplate. It unnecessarily complicates the designing and
implementing of the raw functionality required for a particular application, as
all boilerplate does.</p>
<p>Ideas are floating around to radically redesign the internet. Naming and looking
up things could be vastly improved. Using a human readable text string to locate
and uniquely identify resources seems very antiquated, and very inefficient.
Documents have localized names so we can find them in folders in filing
cabinets. Computers are better at naming things for their uniqueness than humans
(hashes). This is an idea from Joe Armstrong (see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DlKXe3HUG2l4">video</a> 31 minutes in). Peer to
peer protocols (BitTorrent) and other distributed technologies such as
blockchains (bitcoins) are ignoring the old server-client model and embracing
networks for their intrinsic qualities instead of reducing them to a medium to
transport data from A to B. </p>
<p>Academics involved with the original design of the web as we know it now are
rethinking its basic underlying premises, and want to use <a href="http://homepages.cwi.nl/~steven/">magnet links</a> instead
of urls to locate and store content distributed in the network and not at a
centralized server. Popularity of runtimes such as nodejs have promoted the idea
of <a href="http://isomorphic.net/">isomorphic</a> web apps, using the same language on server and client, to the
point of erasing the difference between both where any source code can and does
run on both server and client (<a href="https://www.meteor.com/">meteorjs</a>), not necessarily easing the job of the
developer, but conceptually certainly attractive. Other, but as of yet less
popular solutions of the server-client schism propose to do away with the server
side of affairs all together and deposit all functionality in the client
(<a href="http://hood.ie/">hoodie</a>).</p>
<p>A clear solution is not yet in sight, but the problem seem big to me. In
the next blog post I want to talk about and design an experimental working
application development infrastructure that tries to challenge some of the more
commonly held underlying assumptions of how to deploy a web application. Dns,
load balancing, rest api, ajax, scaling and more are all under fire. If it seems
plausible it&#39;ll be implemented..</p>
